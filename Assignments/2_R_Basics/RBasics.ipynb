    "So let's walk through that. We start with our dataset -- `mountainlions` -- and then we tell it to group the data by a given field in the data. In this case, we wanted to group together all the counties, signified by the field name COUNTY, which you could get from looking at `head(mountainlions)`. So after we group the data, we need to count them up. In dplyr, we use `summarize` [which can do more than just count things](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html). So inside the parentheses in summarize, we set up the summaries we want. In this case, we just want a count of the counties. So `count = n(),` says create a new field, called `count` and set it equal to `n()`, which might look weird, but it's common in stats. The number of things in a dataset? Statisticians call in n. There are n number of incidents in this dataset. So `n()` is a function that counts the number of things there are. \n",
    "\n",
    "And when we run that, we get a list of counties with a count next to them. But it's not in any order. So we'll add another And Then Do This %>% and use `arrange`. Arrange does what you think it does -- it arranges data in order. By default, it's in ascending order -- smallest to largest. But if we want to know the county with the most mountain lion sightings, we need to sort it in descending order. That looks like this:"
