    "So `CleanDate` is the name of the new field we're creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `as.POSIXct` takes some explaining. And there's [a lot more explaining here](http://neondataskills.org/R/time-series-convert-date-time-class-POSIX/). But base R has a couple of ways of parsing dates. The most common one you'll see is `as.Date` which works great, unless you have dates AND times like we do. So you have to use one of two `as.POSIX` variants, `as.POSIXct` and `as.POSIXlt`, and knowing the difference between them isn't useful. So `as.POSIXct` takes some inputs -- the field you're working with, and format of the date field, using some pattern markers that makes sense when you learn what they are. So our date field is `Reported`, so that's what we're using to supply the input data. The format of our data, if we look at the output of head above, is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, or year-month-dayThours:minutes:seconds. The oddball here is the T in the middle. If that wasn't there, we'd have an easier time converting this. But it's there, for a reason some developer somewhere decided, and we have to deal with it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to parse that pattern, we use a set of markers that tell R what this thing in this spot is. You can get all of the markers that are possible in the [strptime documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/strptime.html), but what we have here represents the most common. So `%Y` means four digit year (versus `%y` which is just a two digit year). The rest are pretty self explanator after that, but notice that the dashes, the T and the colons in the time are just typed into it. They too are part of the pattern.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But our question is to count up the total number of incidents per year. So we need to get just a year back, group them together by year and count them. We can do this using `format` and the same markers as before. It looks like this:"
