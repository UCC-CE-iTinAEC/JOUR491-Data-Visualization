__Course description:__

Welcome to data visualization, where you'll learn to use storytelling, analysis and visualization techniques to inform people with data. In this class, you'll learn what makes for good visualizations and how you can develop a deeper understanding of a topic through a combination of words and graphics, forming a new kind of narrative on the web.

__Course goals:__

* Understand the basics of data and data visualization
* Understand the history of data visualization techniques
* Master basic data analysis and visualization tools
* Get hands on experience with more advanced tools
* Publish visual stories using learned techniques to the web via single page web applications

__Required texts:__

* The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte
* The Functional Art: An introduction to information graphics and visualization by Alberto Cairo

__Other requirements:__

* Administrative privileges on a computer so you can install software
* A GitHub account (free)
* A Google account (free)
* A sense of humor (also free)

__News Nerd Slack:__

I use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a way for students to get help from each other and me when we're not in class or not even in the building. I have one News Nerd Slack that includes my current code class, students of past classes and alumni who have gone on to do data journalism professionally. You'll be added to the slack during the semester, and at the end, I'll remove you unless you tell me otherwise. If you like it, stay. If not, no worries and no judgements.

__Class opportunities:__

The opportunities in this class are to experiment with storytelling in a way you have never done before. Creativity and ambition will be rewarded. Copy and pasting will not. As such, this class will require to you try a lot of things on your own. If you've never done this before, it can be a little daunting starting out. To help you, I've set up a time called [Maker Hours](http://www.makerhours.org) where you can come, hang out, learn something new and get help with it. The information is in the link, but the short version is: Most Friday afternoons, room 27, Andersen Hall. This time is open to any student wanting to learn programming, data viz, hardware hacking -- anything in the digital journalism space that can help them tell stories on the web. It's not required for you to show up at Maker Hours, but if you're struggling, stuck, frustrated or just really interested in learning more, come hang out. I promise you it's worth the time.

__Grading:__

I use the standard grading scale.

|Grade|Percentage|
|-----|----------|
|A+|97-100|						
|A|93-96|
|A-|90-92|
|B+|87-89|
|B|83-86|
|B-|80-82|
|C+|77-79|
|C|73-76|						
|C-|70-72|
|D+|67-69|
|D|63-66|					 
|D-|60-62|
|F|59 or below|

However, your final letter grade will be weighted:

Assignment|Weight
----------|------
Reading quizzes|10%
Assignments|60%
Final assignment|30%  

You will be graded on effort, creativity and clarity of your work. Work hard, try new things, let your effort show through in the work and you'll do fine. Mail it in and your grade will reflect it.

A note: Not reflected in the grade weights is how I handle things like attendance and class participation. I do not take attendance, but I know if you are there or not. I do not record class participation, but I do know if you take part in class regularly and contribute. So when it comes time to submit grades, and you're right on the line between a B+ and A-, it's your attendance and participation that will sway me to round up or down. Show up, take part, be present and I round up, sometimes pretty generously. Sit on your phone, skip class, never talk and your grade is your grade, I don't care how close you are.

__Final Project:__
The skills and the ideas we're going to discuss in this class are all building toward a final project where you will tell a story with data. The absolute minimum requirements of this final project are:

* Tell a story with data using visual and narrative techniques discussed in the class.
* This story must use three different types of visualization.
* This story must have multiple data sources.
* The story must use Tarbell for publication.

You will be graded on:

* The story
* The techniques you use
* The sophistication of the visualizations
* The creativity you show
* The effort you put in, evidenced by scrum participation, GitHub code check-ins, the questions you ask, etc.

__Notes on attendance__

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than five ways to get ahold of me. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class and you are behind. We’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril. Assume that you missed something important. And know it is entirely on you to find out what you missed and how to catch up.

__Policies__

Here's the short version.You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.
Now the longer versions.

__ACEJMC Competencies__

After this class, you should be able to:
* Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;
* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;
* Think critically, creatively and independently;
* Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;
* Critically evaluate their own work and that of others for accuracy and fairness, clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness;
* Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts;
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.

__Academic integrity:__

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors. Academic dishonesty includes:

* Handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.* Turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
* Turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes,* Using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.
Anything and everything you include in your work that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions. Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.

__Students with disabilities__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY.

__Diversity__

The College of Journalism and Mass Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.
